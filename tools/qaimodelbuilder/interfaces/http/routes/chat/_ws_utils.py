"""Shared WebSocket helpers for the chat data + control planes.

Centralises the "accept → first-frame send race" guard pattern (the
same race the ``_control_ws.py:165`` hello-send fix addressed). Every
``websocket.accept()`` is followed by at least one ``send_json``, and
the client can disconnect in the tiny window between them (page reload
right after upgrade, tab closed during handshake, …). Without a guard
the disconnect bubbles up as an unhandled ASGI exception and dumps a
noisy traceback (``ClientDisconnected`` → ``WebSocketDisconnect``).

Use :func:`safe_send_json` for every server→client send that may run
in such a window. It returns ``False`` instead of raising when the
peer is gone; callers typically just ``return``.

Mirrors ``_control_ws.py``'s inline catch shape — the same module
uses this helper too (P13 / report D.6) so there is exactly one
implementation. AGENTS.md "复用 > 重造".

    Returns ``True`` if the send succeeded, ``False`` if the peer was
    already gone (or the underlying transport refused mid-send). The

    no longer usable, there is nothing to clean up beyond what
    starlette / uvicorn do on disconnect, and the page will reconnect

      message was already consumed by a prior send attempt on the same
      task).
    * ``ConnectionError`` — covers the uvicorn/asyncio "after close"
      send variants (``ConnectionResetError`` / ``ConnectionAbortedError``).
