"""Pure token-usage aggregation math (C档 阶段2 — usage收口).

Single source of truth for the "cumulative-prompt provider" usage-finalize
口径 that was previously expressed twice with divergent shapes:

* the main agent — ``StreamChatUseCase._finalize_turn_usage``
  (``application/use_cases/streaming.py``): for an Anthropic/Claude turn it
  overrides the summed ``prompt_tokens`` with the LAST round's value and
  recomputes ``total_tokens``, because Claude RE-SENDS the full conversation
  each round so a per-round ``prompt_tokens`` is already the running wire size
  (summing it across rounds is quadratic — the observed 10M-token bug);
* the sub-agent — ``SubAgentSession.accumulate_usage``
  (``domain/sub_agent_session.py``) which SUMs every key (including
  ``prompt_tokens``) into the persisted cumulative ``usage`` and separately
  tracks a replace-last ``last_prompt_tokens`` for the live badge.

This module hosts the ONE pure rule both layers can share. It lives in the
domain layer so both the domain ``SubAgentSession`` entity and the application
``StreamChatUseCase`` may import it without breaking the ``layered-chat``
import-linter contract (application ⇐ domain is the allowed direction; domain
imports nothing upward).

No I/O, no global state, no time, no random — pure functions only.

    providers.

    ``summed`` is the round-over-round SUM of every integer usage key (correct
    for ``completion_tokens`` / ``cache_read_tokens`` — independent and
    additive). For a cumulative-prompt family (``is_cumulative=True``, i.e.
    Anthropic/Claude) the summed ``prompt_tokens`` / ``total_tokens`` are wrong
    (quadratic), so they are overridden:

    * ``prompt_tokens`` ← the LAST round's ``prompt_tokens`` (the true final
      wire size);
    * ``total_tokens`` ← ``prompt_tokens(last round) + completion_tokens(SUM)``
      so the dict stays self-consistent.

    Every other key is preserved verbatim from ``summed``.

    Invariants (zero behaviour change where the SUM was already right):

    * **Single-round turn**: ``last_round == summed`` numerically, so the
      override is a no-op (prompt unchanged; total = prompt + completion which
      for one round equals the model's total).
    * **Non-cumulative provider** (``is_cumulative=False``): returns
      ``dict(summed)`` untouched — their per-round ``prompt_tokens`` is the
      current round only, so the SUM口径 is left exactly as before.
    * **No last-round usage captured** (``None`` / non-dict / missing or
      non-int ``prompt_tokens``): falls back to ``dict(summed)`` (cannot correct
      without the keystone figure).

    The SHAPE (field names / types) is unchanged — only the runtime VALUE of
    ``prompt_tokens`` / ``total_tokens`` is corrected from the bogus SUM to the
    true last-round wire size.
